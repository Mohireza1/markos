## About Markos
This is my first base code for a Telegram bot, based on the original Markinov bot (now offline).
I wrote this base code from scratch, and you can safely assume that everything has initially been by me except for the main idea.

## What Does Markos Exactly Do?
Markos starts with an empty database which can be filled with strings. Markos then returns a random string based on the elements inside the database arrays.
Currently, it only supports English and Persian languages but replacing (not adding) your language only needs a slight change in the regex test of the second language.

## Can I Use Markos?
Yes, of course, you can! Just do not forget to add my name somewhere; thank you!

## What's The Next Step?
To use this base code to create a fully functional Telegram bot.
